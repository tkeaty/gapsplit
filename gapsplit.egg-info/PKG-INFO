Description: =================================================
        GapSplit: universal sampling for metabolic models
        =================================================
        
        * GapSplit is a sampling algorithm designed to generate uniform, high-coverage sample points on any metabolic model
        * regardless of convexity (i.e. logical/integer constraints).
        
        Functions
        ---------
        
        sample(fname, n_points, lower_bounds=None, upper_bounds=None, n_update=100, n_secondary=0)
           * Generate samples from a given input model.
        
           INPUT:
              * fname - str
                    * String representing path to model file (see gurobipy.read() for acceptable file types).
        
              * n_points - int
                    * Number of desired sample points.
        
              * lower_bounds - list/ndarray, optional
                    * FVA minimums for model. Generated if not provided.
        
              * upper_bounds - list/ndarray, optional
                    * FVA maximums for model. Generated if not provided.
        
              * n_update - int, optional
                    * Refresh rate (in points) for console output of current model coverage and sample count.
        
              * n_secondary - int, optional
                    * Number of additional gaps targeted for splitting.
        
           OUTPUT:
              * samples - ndarray
                    * n_points by n_reactions array of sample points.
